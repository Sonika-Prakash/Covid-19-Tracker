            What is corona virus?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
            in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
            to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
            severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
            and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
            discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

            What is COVID-19?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
            discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
            before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

            What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
            dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
            congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
            don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
            80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
            Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
            ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
            underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems
            or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with
            fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            How does COVID-19 spread?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
            disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
            the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
            coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
            the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
            objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
            can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
            with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
            important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
            who is sick.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms??
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
            expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
            from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
            people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
            particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
            possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
            a mild cough and does not feel ill.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
            transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
            through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
            spread?”

            What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
            available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
            countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
            have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
            have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
            situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justified;">
        You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple        precautions:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol- based
                hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing
                your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand
                rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why?
                When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why?
                Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
                contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose
                or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can
                make you sick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
                dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why?
                Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you
                protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and
                COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why?
                National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
                of viruses and other infections.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
                have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?
                You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these
                areas.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified;">
            Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading:
            <ul>
            <li>
                Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for
everyone)
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even
                with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C
                or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential
                for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g.
                to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
                Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities
                will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help
                protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other
                viruses.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
                medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory
                infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
                provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. Why?
                Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly
                direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent
                possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

            No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
            infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.
            Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment
            of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician
            to treat a bacterial infection.

            While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
            comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
            that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not
            recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
            as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several
            ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
            medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon
            as clinical findings are available.

            The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus
            and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of
            the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most

            Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
            animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which
            may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
            associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary
            camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been
            confirmed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified;">
            To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
            direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure
            good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal
            organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid
            consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

            Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?

        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong
            Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
            transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
            produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
            protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
            We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will    update as new findings are available.

        <p style="text-align: justified; text-indent: 50px;">
            It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
            surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
            suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
            COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
            several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
            surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justified;">
            If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant

            In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing
            seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more
            severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with
            your health care provider.
